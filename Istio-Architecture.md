You do not need to install the `istiod` control plane on every node in your Kubernetes cluster. <br/>
The Istio control plane components are deployed in a central location within your Kubernetes cluster on any one worder node in a separate namespace 'istio-system' and it does not need to be installed on every node.<br/>
The primary Istio control plane pod is `istiod`, but depending on the configuration, you might also find other auxiliary pods and services, such as the Istio ingress and egress gateways. <br/>
The data plane components (sidecars and gateways) are distributed across nodes, while `istiod` handles the configuration and management centrally from control plane.<br/>

### Deployment of `istiod`

1. **Centralized Control Plane**: 
   - **Deployment**: The `istiod` control plane component is deployed as a single or a set of pods (typically one per node, but it can be scaled horizontally if needed) in a designated namespace, usually `istio-system`.
   - **Node Distribution**: `istiod` does not need to run on every node. It runs in a central location within the cluster, and its services are exposed to all nodes via Kubernetes services.

2. **Service Discovery**: 
   - **Communication**: Nodes and the sidecar proxies on the pods communicate with `istiod` using Kubernetes services. The control plane components manage the configuration, traffic policies, and certificates centrally, and the data plane proxies (Envoy sidecars) get their configuration from `istiod` through the service discovery mechanisms.

### Deployment of Data Plane

1. **Sidecar Proxies**: 
   - **Injection**: The sidecar proxies, such as Envoy, are injected into application pods as part of the deployment process. These proxies are distributed across all nodes where application pods are scheduled.
   - **Local Communication**: The sidecar proxies on each node communicate with the `istiod` control plane for configuration updates and policy enforcement. 

2. **Gateway Proxies**: 
   - **Ingress/Egress Gateways**: If you are using Istioâ€™s ingress or egress gateways, these are deployed as separate pods and can be scheduled on specific nodes or across multiple nodes depending on the configuration and resource needs.

### Benefits of Centralized Control Plane

- **Resource Efficiency**: By running `istiod` as a centralized service rather than on every node, you save resources and simplify management.
- **Scalability**: You can scale `istiod` horizontally if necessary, depending on the load and the size of your cluster.
- **Management**: Centralized control makes it easier to manage configuration, updates, and policies from a single point.
